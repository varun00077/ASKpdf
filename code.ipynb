The people of India have reposed their faith in the government led by \\nthe Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and re-elected it for a historic \\nthird term under his leadership. We are grateful for their support, faith and \\ntrust in our policies. We are determined to ensure that all Indians, regardless \\nof religion, caste, gender and age, make substantial progress in realising their \\nlife goals and aspirations. \\nGlobal Context \\n2. The global economy, while performing better than expected, is still in \\nthe grip of policy uncertainties. Elevated asset prices, political uncertainties \\nand shipping disruptions continue to pose significant downside risks for \\ngrowth and upside risks to inflation.  \\n3. In this context, India’s economic growth  continues  to be the shining \\nexception and will remain so in the years ahead. India’s inflation continues to \\nbe low, stable and moving towards the 4 per cent target. Core inflation (non-\\nfood, non -fuel) currently is 3.1 per cent. Steps are being taken to ensure \\nsupplies of perishable goods reach market adequately.'),\n",

For Annadata, we announced higher Minimum Support \\nPrices a month ago for all major crops, delivering on the promise of at least a \\n50 per cent margin over costs. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana was \\nextended for five years, benefitting more than 80 crore people.  \\n5. Administrative actio ns for approval and implementation of various \\nschemes announced in the interim budget are well underway. The required \\nallocations have been made.   \\nBudget Theme \\n6. Turning attention to the full year and beyond, in this budget, we \\nparticularly focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class. I am \\nhappy to announce the Prime Minister’s package of 5 schemes and initiatives \\nto facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth \\nover a 5-year period with a central outlay of ` 2 lakh crore.  I will speak about \\nthem shortly, while more details may be seen in the annexure.

The people have given a unique opportunity to  our government to \\ntake the country on the path of strong development and all-round prosperity. \\nIn the interim budget, we promised to present a detailed roadmap for our \\npursuit of ‘ Viksit Bharat’.

We will continue our efforts to simplify taxes, improve tax payer \\nservices, provide tax certainty and reduce litigation while enhancing revenues \\nfor funding the development and welfare schemes of the government. \\n136. It has been our endeavour to simplify taxation. We have taken a \\nnumber of measures in the last few years i ncluding introduction of simplified \\ntax regimes without exemptions and deductions for corporate tax and \\npersonal income tax. This has been appreciated by tax payers. 58 per cent of \\ncorporate tax came from the simplified tax regime in financial year 2022 -23. \\nSimilarly, as per data available till now for the last fiscal, more than two -\\nthirds have availed the new personal income tax regime. \\nComprehensive Review of the Income-tax Act, 1961 \\n137. I am now announcing a comprehensive review of the Income -tax Act, \\n1961. The purpose is to make the Act concise, lucid, easy to read and \\nunderstand. This will reduce disputes and litigation, thereby providing tax \\ncertainty to the tax payers. It will also bring down the demand embroiled in \\nlitigation. It is proposed to be completed in six months. \\n138. A beginning is being made in the Finance Bill by simplifying the tax \\nregime for charities, TDS rate structure, provisions for reassessment and \\nsearch provisions and capital gains taxation. \\nSimplification for Charities and of TDS \\n139. The two tax exemption regimes for charities are proposed to be \\nmerged into one. The 5 per cent TDS rate on many payments is being merged \\ninto the 2 per cent TDS rate and the 20 per cent TDS ra te on repurchase  of \\nunits by mutual funds or UTI is being withdrawn. TDS rate on e -commerce \\noperators is proposed to be reduced from one to 0.1 per cent. Moreover, \\ncredit of TCS is proposed to be given in the TDS to be deducted on salary. \\nFurther, I propose to decriminalize delay for payment of TDS up to  the due \\ndate of filing statement for the same. I also plan to provide a standard \\noperating procedure for TDS defaults and simplify and rationalise the \\ncompounding guidelines for such defaults.'),\n",

I propose to thoroughly simplif y the provisions for reopening and \\nreassessment. An assessment hereinafter can be reopened beyond three \\nyears from the end of the assessment year only if the escaped income is  \\n₹ 50 lakh or more,  up to a maximum period of five years from the end of the \\nassessment year. Even in search cases, a time limit of six years before the \\nyear of search, as against the existing time limit of ten years, is proposed.  \\nThis will reduce tax-uncertainty and disputes. \\nSimplification and Rationalisation of Capital Gains  \\n141. Capital gains taxation is also proposed to be hugely simplified.  \\n142. Short term gains on certain financial assets shall henceforth attract a \\ntax rate of 20 per cent, while that on all other financial assets and all  \\nnon-financial assets shall continue to attract the applicable tax rate. \\n143. Long term gains on all financial and non -financial assets, on the other \\nhand, will attract a tax rate of 12.5 per cent. For the benefit of the lower and \\nmiddle-income classes, I propose to increase the limit of exemption of capital \\ngains on certain financial assets to ₹ 1.25 lakh per year. \\n144. Listed financial assets held for more than a year will be classified as \\nlong term, while unlisted financial assets and all non -financial assets will have \\nto be held for at least two years to be classified as long-term.  \\n145. Unlisted bonds and debentures, debt mutual funds and market linked \\ndebentures, irrespective of holding period, however, will attract tax on \\ncapital gains at applicable rates. \\nTax Payer Services \\n146. All the major tax payer services unde r GST and most services under \\nCustoms and Income Tax have been digitalised. All remaining services of \\nCustoms and Income Tax including rectification and order giving effect to \\nappellate orders shall be digitalized and made paper- less over the next two \\nyears. \\nLitigation and Appeals \\n147. While our concerted efforts to reduce pendency of appeals at various \\nappellate fora are beginning to show good results, it will continue to engage \\nour highest attention.'),\n",

To dispose of the backlog of first appeals, I plan to deploy  more \\nofficers  to hear and decide such appeals, especially those with large tax \\neffect.  \\n149. For resolution of certain income tax disputes pending in appeal, I am \\nalso proposing Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme, 2024.  \\n150. Further, I propose to increase monetary limits for filing appeals \\nrelated to direct taxes, excise and service tax in the Tax Tribunals, High Courts \\nand Supreme Court to ₹  60 lakh, ₹ 2 crore and ₹ 5 crore respectively. \\n151. With a view to reduce litigation and provide certainty in international \\ntaxation, we  will expand the scope of safe harbour rules and make them \\nmore attractive. We will also streamline the transfer pricing assessment \\nprocedure. \\nEmployment and Investment \\n152. I have a few proposals to promote  investment and foster \\nemployment.  \\n153. First of all, to bolster the Indian start- up eco -system, boost the \\nentrepreneurial spirit and support innovation, I propose to abolish the so -\\ncalled angel tax for all classes of investors. \\n154. Second, there is tremendous potential for cruise tourism in India. To \\ngive a fillip to this employment generating industry, I am proposing a simpler \\ntax regime for foreign shipping companies operating domestic cruises in the \\ncountry. \\n155. Third, India is a world leader in the diamond cutting and polishing \\nindustry, which employs a large number of skilled workers. To further \\npromote the development of this sector, we would provide for safe harbour \\nrates for foreign mining companies selling raw diamonds in the country. \\n156. Fourth, to attract foreign capital for our development needs,  \\nI propose to reduce the corporate tax rate on foreign companies from 40 to \\n35 per cent.'),\n",

I have a couple of proposals for deepening the tax base. First, Security \\nTransactions Tax on futures and options of securities is proposed to be \\nincreased to 0.02 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. Second, for reasons \\nof equity, I propose to tax income received on buy back of shares in the \\nhands of the recipient.  \\nOthers \\n158. To improve social security benefits, deduction of expenditure by \\nemployers towards NPS is proposed to be increased from 10 to 14 per cent of \\nthe employee’s salary. Similarly, deduction of this expenditure up to 14 per \\ncent of salary from the income of  employees in private sector, public sector \\nbanks and undertakings, opting for the new tax regime, is proposed to be \\nprovided. \\n159. Indian professionals working in multinationals get ESOPs and invest in \\nsocial security schemes and other movable  assets abroad. Non -reporting of \\nsuch small foreign assets has penal consequences under the Black Money \\nAct. Such non- reporting of movable assets up to ₹ 20 lakh is proposed to be \\nde-penalised. \\n160. Other major proposals in the Finance Bill relate to: \\n• Withdrawal of equalization levy of 2 per cent; \\n• Expansion of tax benefits to certain funds and entities in IFSCs; and \\n• immunity from penalty and prosecution to benamidar on full and \\ntrue disclosure so as to improve conviction under the Benami \\nTransactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988. \\nPersonal Income Tax \\n161. Coming to Personal Income Tax Rates, I have two announcements to \\nmake for those opting for the new tax regime. First, the standard deduction \\nfor salaried employees is proposed to be increased from ₹50,000/ - to  \\n₹75,000/-. Similarly, deduction on family pension for pensioners is proposed \\nto be enhanced from ₹  15,000/- to ₹ 25,000/ -. This will provide relief to \\nabout four crore salaried individuals and pensioners.'),\n",
